# Interpreting-Doctors-Handwritten-Notes-using-Deep-Learning
The project aims to address the issue of illegible doctor handwriting, a problem leading to medication errors and potential harm to patients. The proposed solution involves developing a system that utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network, to recognize and interpret handwritten medical text. The system will be trained on a substantial dataset of handwritten medical documents, undergo preprocessing, and incorporate additional deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project includes a thorough literature review, analysis of existing systems, and outlines evaluation metrics such as accuracy, speed, and robustness. Suggestions for improvement involve adding visual aids, providing more details about the dataset, explaining the training process, addressing challenges and limitations, discussing future work, and considering ethical considerations. The ultimate goal of the project is to enhance patient safety and healthcare outcomes by improving the accuracy and efficiency of interpreting handwritten medical text.
